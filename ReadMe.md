### Git setup

Since Windows and UNIX-based systems differ in terms of line endings, it is a very good idea to configure git autocrlf settings.

* On *Windows* we recommend setting `core.autocrlf` to `true`.
	``` bash
	git config --global core.autocrlf true
	```

* On *Mac* we recommend setting `core.autocrlf` to `input`.
	``` bash
	git config --global core.autocrlf input
	```

### Code style guidelines

Please use 2 spaces for indentation.
